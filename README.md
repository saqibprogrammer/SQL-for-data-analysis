Chinook Database
Introduction
In this project, you will query the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. For this project, you will be assisting the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information. To assist you in the queries ahead, the schema for the Chinook Database is provided below. You can see the columns that link tables together via the arrows.


All of the below instructions are discussed in detail as we work through this lesson on your way to completing this project. The below serves as a quick reference of what you will be doing as you progress through the completion of this project.

Data Model
The Chinook data model represents a digital media store, including tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices and customers. You can see the Chinook data model here.

Sample Data
Media related data was created using real data from an iTunes Library. It is possible for you to use your own iTunes Library to generate the SQL scripts.
Customer and employee information was manually created using fictitious names, addresses that can be located on Google maps, and other well formatted data (phone, fax, email, etc.). Sales information is auto generated using random data for a four year period.

Why the name Chinook?
The name of this sample database was based on the Northwind database. Chinooks are winds in the interior West of North America, where the Canadian Prairies and Great Plains meet various mountain ranges. Chinooks are most prevalent over southern Alberta in Canada. Chinook is a good name choice for a database that intents to be an alternative to Northwind.
